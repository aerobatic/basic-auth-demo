**We now recommend the [password-protect](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/plugins/password-protect/) plugin instead**

This is a sample web app showing how to implement basic auth for your Aerobatic hosted web site. More information can be found in the [Aerobatic documentation](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/plugins/basic-auth/).

The web app can be viewed at [https://auth-demo.aerobatic.io/](https://auth-demo.aerobatic.io/)
